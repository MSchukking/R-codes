# R-codes
R codes used to analyse Affymetrix expression datasets 

During my Ph.D research I worked on miRNAs. 
miRNAs bind to mRNA and in that way can degrade it (resulting in lower gene expression) or can stabalize it (resulting in higher gene expression)

I made this code to find if the expression of a certain miRNA and mRNA were correlated to each other. 
If they are correlated, this could indicate if this miRNA regulates the expression of that gene.
